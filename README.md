# Research Interests

Software Engineering is more than a technical challenge, and in most cases it is tedious. As a former developer, my research goal is to provide practitioners with useful advice and toolchains from both societal and technical aspects to make development and maintenance easier. 

* Software Maintainability
  * Code Smell and Anti-Pattern
  * Architectural Degradation and Software Aging
  * Community Smell and Social Debt
  * Technical Debt
* Software Reliability
  * Bug Report Analysis
  * Defect Prioritization and Characterization
  * Reliability Engineering
* Software Engineering in Society (SEIS)
* Mining Software Repository (MSR) and Software Artifacts
